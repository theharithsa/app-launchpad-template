# Foundation checks

Python 3.11+ and a POSIX shell; standard library only:

```sh
sh scripts/check.sh
python3 scripts/check_foundation.py --json
python3 scripts/check_foundation.py --ready --json
```

The shared entrypoint validates metadata, versions, skills, local Markdown links, the public documentation build and its HTML links, and unit tests. In PR CI it also requires a documentation impact decision in the PR body. README, catalog and CI use the same entrypoint. Foundation validator JSON includes `ok`, deterministic `errors`, and `ready` (whether discovery checks were requested). Failures exit nonzero.

The [schemas](../schemas/README.md) own field shapes. The Python gate adds internal-path/reference/dependency checks and ready/active semantics. Tests cover multi-error diagnostics, malformed structures, schema/constant parity, SemVer, service generation and rollback, link failures, CI command agreement and ruleset dry-run behavior.

For actual application suites follow the [test contract](../.agents/skills/app-launchpad/references/testing.md) and [evidence rules](../.agents/skills/app-launchpad/references/evidence.md). Record real commands/prerequisites in the relevant service skill after stack selection. `examples/` is synthetic reference material and never execution proof or a cataloged service. Raw local artifacts remain ignored under `qa/local/` or `qa/raw/`.
